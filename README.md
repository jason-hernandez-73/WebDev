# WebDev

This project was to practice building a website using CSS and Bootstrap, which I had not previously done. Prior to this, I did everything in HTML; but now that newer versions of HTML have deprecated much of that formatting, it proved necessary to update accordingly.

The website used data from an API project, collecting weather data from a list of cities around the world.
